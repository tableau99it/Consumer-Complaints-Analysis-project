# Titles :- Consumer Complaint Analysis

# Introduction:-

Customer complaints is an important issue that needs to be addressed and resolved in both public
and private sectors of service providers. Customer complaints can be used as an accurate measure of how successful
a service is, especially with the transformation of information technology into concepts and ideas. The competitive
advantage of some companies is not the service offered but rather the attention to customer complaints and
resolution. In fact, there is a risk to the company when the client is silent and not complaining. When the client is
faced with a problem, usually he/she has two options to go with: either grumble from the company and disconnect
from them permanently or complain. Therefore, it is very important to rely on a mechanism that helps the Customer
Relationship Management (CRM) division in each company to analyze and handle complaints. In this paper, we
analyze customer complaints dataset from a public service provider, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority
(MTA) public transportation service provider, which provides services such as subway, bus and rail. 

A lack of complaints or a small number of complaints against a product, 
issue, or firm in the database does not necessarily imply that there is little or no consumer harm. 
Consumers may be harmed in ways that do not cause them to file a complaint with the Bureau or to blame the product or provider for the harm they have suffered, depending on the nature of the financial product and how consumers use it. Consider firm size and/or market share when analyzing complaint volume about a company or product. Companies with more consumers. That's why i have built scalable machine learning pipeline to predicted "consumer complaint will be disputed or not" through help Convolutional Neural Network in Deep Learning with 81% accuracy.
